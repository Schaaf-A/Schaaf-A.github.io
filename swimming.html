    <h1>Why I Like to go Swimming</h1>
    <p>Swimming is my favorite summer activity. When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not impressive, only three feet deep, but its mine.</p>

        <h3>There are three reasons I like to swim:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I get lots of exercise </li>
            <li>I enjoy the freedom </li>
            <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun </li>
        </ul>
